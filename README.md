# A React based drum machine

This is a simple react app that recreates some of the sounds from the Korg-ER1 synthesizer. The drum machine accepts both keyboard and mouse inputs, so feel free to experiment!

This project was created as a part of the Front End Development Libraries certification for Free Code Camp.
